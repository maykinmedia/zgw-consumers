# Test files for certificate model

## Certificate and key

The `test.certificate` and the `test.key` were generated using the following command:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out test.certificate -keyout test.key
```

The tests making use of these certificates are:
- `tests/test_certificates.py`

These tests will potentially start failing once the test certificate expires.
